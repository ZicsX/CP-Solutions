"""
For a positive integer n, let str(n) be the string representing n in decimal.
We say that a positive integer n is periodic when there exists a positive integer m such that str(n) is the concatenation of two or more copies of str(m). For example, 11, 1212, and 123123123 are periodic.
You are given a positive integer N at least 11. Find the greatest periodic number at most N. It can be proved that there is at least one periodic number at most N.
